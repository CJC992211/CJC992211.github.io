# About me

Hi! Welcome to my website. My name Courtney and I am a recent college graduate (B.S. in Biological Sciences and Chemistry minor!). Biology is one of my biggest passions and has fascinated me for a long time. In particular, cellular biology is my favorite. A new found interest of mine that I would like to continue learning about is data science and coding. Eventually, I would like to attend graduate school and earn a PhD with a focus on cellular biology and data science.
